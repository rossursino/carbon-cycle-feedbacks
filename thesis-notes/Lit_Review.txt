This text file documents any changes that are to be made from the submitted literature review for the final thesis.
The changes are mainly based on the feedback given about the literature review, as well as any major changes to the content, inaccurate information and other small changes.

NOTE: It is important to see if the Lit Review is simply "inserted" into the Thesis or if there are changes. 

- First four paragraphs should try to be presented more clearly as to "give a much mor clearer picture of what is planned to the reader who is not familiar to this topic."
"At times the description is very short and can perhaps confuse more than help".

- Provide a fuller understanding of how the system physics itself induces nonlinearity of the carbon cycle feedbacks, rather than just stating and explaining the mathematical equations.
Provide a fuller understanding of the physics behind the mathematical relationships.

- R+S and possibly include: 

Dana Ehlert, Kirsten Zickfeld, Michael Eby and Nathan Gillett, 2017: The sensitivity of the proportionality between temperature change and cumulative CO2 emissions to ocean mixing. Journal of Climate, 30, 2921-2935, doi: 10.1175/JCLI-D-16-0247.1.

- Change Figure 2 to a Table [no.] as it is just a table.

- Do we need "Significance and Innovation" as a section, or does it either inserted into the "Introduction" or completely removed?

- Under the section "Significance and Innovation":
	change the idea that it is a new approach to use inversions to reduce uncertainties in the feedbacks because Rayner2015 attempted this.

- Put more emphasis on the fact that this study will go on from Rayner2015.

- Does "Preliminary Results" just go into "Results" of the Thesis or is it not included?

- Figure 4 labelling is poor, fix it if using it in Thesis. Also there is a grammatical error in the caption.

- Referencing details need fixing and pick a consistent style. Details of the errors are in the first feedback review.

- C4MIP and CMIP5 (and 6) are incorrectly spelt.

- (End of 1st paragraph) May be good to mention other research/progress such as nitrogen deposition.

- (When explaining the terms in the Friedlingstein equations) makes sure to mention that the change in uptake, concentrations etc. is from the start of the pre-industrial period OR each year as an increment (this needs to be decided).

- "These equations have been the source of considerable confusion about studies either describing a change in carbon uptake or a change in atmospheric concentrations as the linear combination of atmospheric concentrations and temperature"
	While it is great that this point was made in terms of attempting to cover/summarise as much of the relevant literature as possible, this point (and a few other ones) needed an explanation rather than just a statement. Both reviewers mentioned that simply stating these points without any further discussions could confuse more than help.

- Use F_BIM, not F_IMB!

- (just above "Significance and Innovation") it is eq 5 not 15.

- (just above "Significance and Innovation", and in general) avoid using "climate sensitivity" (even "climate sensitivity parameters") as it refers to a climate term that does not have anything to do with feedbacks. Using these terms will cause confusion. Instead use "both climate/temperature and CO2 concentration feedback parameters" or something similar.

- when saying "changes in CO2 concentration" it should be made clear (or at least pre-defined) what the changes are from (are they from pre-industrial or annually?)

- don't say "extremely significant" when trying to talk about statistical significance. It tends to put reviewers off.

Any other details can be viewed in the feedbacks.
