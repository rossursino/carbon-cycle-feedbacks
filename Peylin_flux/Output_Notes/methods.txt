1.1 Overview / Introduction

1.2 Basic Timeseries Analysis

- Of most significance here is to look at the land and ocean carbon uptake timeseries (observations - GCP) and discuss the most important timescales, which is seasonal, interannual, decadal and long-term, as well as the differences between each of the timescales when analysing uptake.
- For example, [this is more of a point in the Introduction or early in the Results] while there is large interannual variability, it is shown clearly that there is a long-term increase in both land and ocean uptake over the last 60 years and this increase can be clearly explained by physical drivers (CO2 fertilisation effect).
- [also a point to go in the early part of Results] Then compare the uptake of the inversion models to show that the trend over the whole time period is consistent with GCP observations. The mean of the timeseries is not important, but it is worth noting that the shift in the mean ocean uptake in Rayner's model is *possibly* due to an error made during the inversion or its output.


1.3 Rolling gradient analysis

1.4 Deseasonalisation and low-pass filtering
1.4.1 Monthly vs. annual temporal resolution of carbon uptake fluxes
- Annual fluxes do not provide a high enough temporal resolution to conduct analyses to determine the long-term trends of carbon uptake.
- Monthly fluxes increase the temporal resolution 12 times over, providing much more capability to analyse uptake and determine long-term trends.
- Monthly fluxes of land carbon uptake contain large seasonal (less than one year) variability which makes it difficult to dissect the long-term trends. This is not a problem for oceanic fluxes.
- We can remove these variabilities to enable the usefulness of monthly data.


1.4.2 Deseasonalisation technique
- Deseasonalisation can provide an easy and efficient way of removing the seasonal variabilities in land fluxes by removing the mean of each month in all the values.
- [Explain mathematically and qualitatively how it works].
- Spectral analysis (power spectral density) of land uptake with and without the deseasonalisation shows clearly the removal of the frequencies in the timeseries (exactly the ones we wanted to remove - 12 month and the others which is 6 and 3 months)
[show plot in low-pass-filter.ipynb].


1.5 Spectral Analysis
- Use welch method to obtain periodogram of timeseries and therefore a power spectral density (PSD).
- The higher the resolution, the better the sampling frequencies and therefore the more resolved the PSD will be. Hence, must use either deseasonaliation or low-pass-filter on the land fluxes before applying spectral analysis.


1.6 Beta and Gamma feedbacks and equations
- [Explain beta and gamma - already completed in the Lit Review although needs some touches].
- Trends in uptake will be analysed through the use of a set of two equations in Friedlingstein2003:
    - (Land,Ocean) dU = beta*dCO2 + gamma*dT
- A simplier approach could be to remove the gamma*dT term to see changes in uptake due to any collinear variable (dU = beta*dT) and see if there is a departure in the long-term linear trend (such as in Rayner2015 paper).
- Another approach might be to take a non-linear fit and compare it to the long-term linear fit.
- The use of the full equation means the application of a Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression. This would need to be applied on decadal timescales (or possibly could take the "rolling gradient approach" here).
