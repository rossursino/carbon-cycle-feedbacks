1.4.1 Monthly vs. annual temporal resolution of carbon uptake fluxes
- Annual fluxes do not provide a high enough temporal resolution to conduct analyses to determine the long-term trends of carbon uptake.
- Monthly fluxes increase the temporal resolution 12 times over, providing much more capability to analyse uptake and determine long-term trends.
- Monthly fluxes of land carbon uptake contain large seasonal (less than one year) variability which makes it difficult to dissect the long-term trends. This is not a problem for oceanic fluxes.
- We can remove these variabilities to enable the usefulness of monthly data.

1.4.2 Deseasonalisation technique
- Deseasonalisation can provide an easy and efficient way of removing the seasonal variabilities in land fluxes by removing the mean of each month in all the values.
- [Explain mathematically and qualitatively how it works].
- Spectral analysis (power spectral density) of land uptake with and without the deseasonalisation shows clearly the removal of the frequencies in the timeseries (exactly the ones we wanted to remove - 12 month and the others which is 6 and 3 months)
[show plot in low-pass-filter.ipynb].


1.5 Spectral Analysis
- Use welch method to obtain periodogram of timeseries and therefore a power spectral density (PSD).
- The higher the resolution, the better the sampling frequencies and therefore the more resolved the PSD will be. Hence, must use either deseasonaliation or low-pass-filter on the land fluxes before applying spectral analysis.
