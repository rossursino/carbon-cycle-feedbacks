The following provides details of each relevant topic to serve the background of the project.
This was done in the Lit Review, however there are changes to be made, such as:
- new topics
- changing content in existing topics based on feedback of Lit Review and general improvements of knowledge.

1.1 Introduction, signficance, Aim
1.2 Carbon budget
1.3 Carbon concentration and climate feedbacks
1.3.1 Physical descriptions and how it affects the carbon cycle
1.3.2 Hypothesis of what it might change the carbon cycle in the future (and therefore CO2 concentrations i.e. higher than we expect, lower?)
1.3.3 Mathematical representations
1.4 Inversion models (brief) and output
1.5 Airborne fraction
