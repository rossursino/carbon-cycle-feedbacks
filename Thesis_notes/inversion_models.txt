1.1 Overview / Introduction about inversion models
[defn of inversion model]
[what they do, why they came about].
[how do they output the uptake timeseries used in the project?]



1.2 Description of each inversion model
- Each inversion model has been run in different time periods as shown [in the table] below:
(Table)
Rayner: 1992-2012
JAMSTEC: 1996-2017
CTRACKER: 2000-2017
CAMS: ?-2017
JENA_s76: 1976-2017
JENA_s85: 1985-2017
[any other differences, which might include things like how they were run, if anything cuased the output of one model to be different from the others etc.]



1.3 Model evaluation against observations (GCP)
1.3.1 Uptake timeseries against GCP
(Figures 5a & 5b)
- Timeseries from all of the six inversion models show good agreement in the mean and trend against the GCP (details in 1.4.1) [perhaps reverse roles of these subsections].

1.3.2 ...


1.4 Results
1.4.1 Uptake timeseries
(Figures 6a & 6b)
- Timeseries from all of the six inversion models show good agreement in the mean and the trend.
This is with the exception of the ocean uptake from Rayner's model, where the mean is shifted upwards from the five models, however the trend is still consistent.
This is being investigated by the [author?].


1.4.2 Rolling gradient



1.4.3 Spectral Analysis and significance
1.4.3.1 Power Spectrums of monthly uptake after deseasonalisation
- There are spikes at 1 year and 4 year periods.
This could be related to temperature. A comparison of the power spectrum of uptake to global monthly temperature can help to verify this.
- [What are the long-term periods showing?]
- [Show AR1 process to see which frequencies/periods are statistically signficant (over the 95% confidence interval).
Also don't forget how much frequencies go outside the interval, as there is a considerably high chance that at least one will go outside].

1.4.3.2 Comparison with global monthly temperature
- The power spectral density (psd) of the land uptake timeseries from the inversion model and the global monthly land temperature (HadCRUT) can be compared.
- There are common periods of significance (where there is power or "spikes") at around the 1 and 4 year periods.
- 4 year period: This can be explained by the influence of ENSO on temperature, which in turn is affecting uptake [confirm this, plus will need more elobaration/evidence].
Could this show how temperature is affecting uptake and on interannual scales [there are many papers showing this, just refer to them for evidence and elobaration].
- 1 year period: this is clearly the visualisation of the seasonal cycle.
Could simply be that the sun's seasonal cycle is affecting both temperature and uptake in the same way but independently [not confirmed, some papers might confirm this].
