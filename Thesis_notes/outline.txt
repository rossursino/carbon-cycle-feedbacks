- Introduction
- Aim
- Literature Review
- Background, which includes:
	- carbon budget
	- feedbacks, including equations from Friedlingstein paper and their physical explanations.
	- inversion models
	- airborne fraction
	- terrestrial models

TOPIC 1: Past trends of carbon uptake - models and observations
- Methods, which include:
	- techniques for linear regression of uptake.
	- timeseries analysis of uptake (frequency analysis, deseasonalisation).
	- treatment of inversion and terrestrial model outputs (calculations to obtain global values and regional partitions, uncertainties, model evaluation again Global Carbon Project)
	- comparison between global and regional trends.
	- treatment of gridded temperature data.
- Results & Discussion


TOPIC 2: Feedback analysis
- Methods, which include:
	- carbon and climate feedback analyses and mathematical equations.

- Results & Discussion


TOPIC 3: Airborne fraction
- Methods, which include:
	- determination of airbrone fraction using equations from Gregory paper.

- Results & Discussion


- Conclusion
